League of Legends is a game where 2 teams of 5 players confront their skills. The winner of the game will be the first team that break the ennemies nexus, a building in the game.

In dataset you will find the first 10 minutes of many match played by very good players. You will also find which team won the game.

In this project, I'll try to define which team will win the game at the end with only the first 10 minutes of gaming.
